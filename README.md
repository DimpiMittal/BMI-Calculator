# BMI Calculator

A simple web-based BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator using Python and PyWebIO.

## Features

- Calculate BMI based on height and weight
- Categorizes BMI into different weight categories
- User-friendly interface

## About the Code

This project uses Python and the PyWebIO library to create a web-based BMI calculator. The main script, `bmi_calculator.py`, defines a function that takes user input for height and weight, calculates the BMI, and displays the result along with the BMI category.

The styling is done using custom CSS injected into the HTML through PyWebIO's `put_html` function, which ensures a clean and user-friendly interface.

## About PyWebIO

PyWebIO is a Python library that allows you to build simple web applications using only Python scripts. It provides a set of interactive functions to get user input and display output, making it easy to create web applications without needing to write HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
